        <h2>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</h2>
        <p>My interests lie in numerous areas within IT. For example, I find cyber security and ethical hacking very interesting but at the same time, I also find web development, or mobile app development just as interesting.</p>

            <p>Since my father worked at IBM for more than 30 years, my interest in the IT world began at a very young age. I was not only surrounded by computers and other technology, but I was also able to ask him all sorts of questions about how computers and the internet worked. Whatever he didn’t know, we would search it up on Google together.</p>
            
        <p>Throughout the years, I’ve taken steps towards my higher education and professional development within the IT field. I’ve become better educated and more knowledgeable in general. Doing this University course takes it one step further towards my ultimate goals to work as an IT professional as my chosen career pathway.</p>       
        <h2>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h2>
        <p>I chose to enrol in the Bachelor of IT degree at RMIT because they offered a flexible, online course which looked appealing to me as something that would keep me engaged and learning, whilst also preparing me for a real career in the IT sector. Additionally, I was more drawn towards RMIT because it is a well-regarded higher educational institution that prepares students with industry relevant and up to date subject material.</p>
        <h2>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h2>
        <p>I would expect to learn about programming and networking things, how technology impacts different areas of the world and maybe some of the foundation blocks that could lead to making real change in the world tomorrow.</p>

            <h2>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h2>

            <p>The test results show a few of my more prominent qualities, including being a people person who enjoys working hard towards achieving goals. It also confirmed that I am a visual learner who responds to visual stimuli and can easily map out creative ideas using various computer programs.</p>

            <h2>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h2>

            <p>I am able to work both independently and with others, working well in a teamwork scenario. I would be able to make positive contributions due to my good imagination and creativity, but not sacrificing on important deadlines either.</p>

            <h2>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h2>

            <p>I have a slight weakness in emotional stability so I would have to ensure that I keep calm under pressure, but also help others around me stick to the project deadlines as I am much higher than average on the conscientious scale.</p>
            <div class="project mt-5">
                <h1 class="text-center mb-2">Project Idea</h1>
                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>My project idea is to create a modern news application for the Android platform, which is similar to Google News, however, acts as a reader of many different news publications in mixed media format (e.g. video, audio, text), all combined into one seamless feed. This application will have a simpler, modern and clean looking graphical user interface for ease of use amongst all age groups and compatibility with all android devices such as smartphones and tablets.</p>
                <p>To cater to multiple age groups both young and old, there will be news catered to these different age groups, targeted towards users based on their account details. Consumers will be able to create an account and given the option to customise their own specific news feed, as well as share content resulting from better integration with other social media platforms including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram. The application itself will also provide users with an opportunity to engage in the comments, but it will be optimised for android mobile phone users which is an advantage and a step above other news websites which may favour desktop, laptop or tablet users. </p>
                <h2>Motivation</h2>
                <p>In a recent study conducted by the ABC with a survey of young people aged 10-17 about news media and their thoughts on the importance of news (Source: https://www.abc.net.au/cm/lb/12984636/data/young-people-and-news-engagement-report-2020-data.pdf), there were some very interesting findings. When survey participants were asked how often they read, watch or listen to the news media, the majority of respondents said it was either very important (31%) or somewhat important (53%) to be engaged with news media. However, only 11% found it was not very important and 5% not at all important. </p>
                <p>These survey findings mentioned above suggest a more positive trend towards the relationship between young people and how they value the consumption of news media in their everyday lives. Therefore, my main motivation for this project is to cater to people who do not wish to disengage from the news, but rather embrace it and make it work for them. An issue which I have regularly encountered is having to wander through the sea of online news sources much direction and ease of use. However, with the functionality of curated news on the app for different age groups, there is a potential for drawing back young people under 30 into consuming news more regularly. I wish to encourage active participation with the news media in Australia, to create awareness of what is going on around in society on a local, national and global scale.</p>
                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>As mentioned previously, the layout of the application will be a clean but stylish and modern UI, not necessarily as stripped down as something like Google News. This involves white background colours with neon borders, as well as making good use of geometric shapes for an eye-catching look and ease of reading. </p>
                <p>The ability to sign in using Facebook or Google accounts will ensure a seamless link to other social media platforms. In addition, users will be able to create their own account which will then dictate the news sites that are more likely to cater to their specific age group. However, the application will also use AI to predict and suggest news articles based upon previous usage habits and preferences which users have selected themselves. Thus, the effect of how users will be presented news is twofold: the application will gather content automatically and aggregate on the app, however the news content can also be selected by individual users according to their specific preferences of news categories. This will include categories such as Politics, Sports, Tech, Young people issues, Entertainment, Music, etc. </p>
                <p>While Facebook will be one of the biggest markets for older users who are currently using the platform more than ever before, short video content will also be presented which summaries important news stories for younger generations to consume and encourage them to be posted to Instagram, TikTok, Facebook and YouTube. Moreover, the ability to sign in using other accounts like Google or Facebook allows for a streamlined link to social media, as this is one of the primary ways people access news in the year 2020, particularly following the global COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
                <h2>Tools, Technologies and Skills Required</h2>
                <p>For this project to be developed and implemented, there are a few key skills which I will need to employ in order to deliver the project outcomes. These include my skills with programming languages such as Java, as well as utilising the Android Studio application to create the final application. These tools will help me towards successful project completion with relative ease.</p>
                <p>The feasibility for finding those skills will be simple to achieve, as I have already gained knowledge in using Java to write the program in Android Studio. In addition, I also have previous experience of using the Android Studio platform. There is no specific hardware required other than an android mobile phone device, so accessibility to the final project application will be easy to accomplish.</p>
                <h2>Outcome</h2>
                <p>If the project is successful, the application could be a lucrative app on the Google Play store where news media outlets would be keen to get on board and ensure their content is shared on the application. This application will also encourage news sites to continue to provide a broad range of news coverage for a variety of audiences. </p>
                <p>The problem with people disengaging with the news may be solved with the help of social media integration and a mixed media format of video, audio, visual and text-based news coverage. Keeping people informed while making them feel like their preferences matter and they can share snippets of short, interesting news with their friends may help people engage with the news on a more regular basis.</p>
                <p>The impacts of the project would be far reaching in Australia, as more people have become aware of just how important access to reliable news is in the year 2020, particularly when there has been a lot of misinformation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. However, if news is not made interesting, attention grabbing and easy to navigate, this may discourage people from engaging with the news of what is happening around them on a deeper level. Therefore, I hope that this application would help address those issues where I feel there is currently a gap in the market for a simple, accessible news application with customisable features for all ages.</p>
